Welcome to my blog! I am Bittor AlaÃ±a, a <AgeSpan/> year-old
Software Architect from Bilbao, Basque Country. I work for Kurago
Software, a member of Bystronic Group. We are specialists in the
sheet metal industry, and are striving to develop a smart factory
that will fulfill the vision of Industry 4.0.

This web is simply a little portfolio I have made myself, to
showcase who I am and what my interests are. I hope I can make
some contributions from time to this blog from time to time ðŸ˜Š.

My passions include (but are not limited to):
- Hiking in the mountain.
- Kickboxing and basketball.
- Reading.
- Cooking.
- Coding and problem solving.
- Sipping a coffee or glass of wine with friends and family.

Computer Science-wise, I am very keen on Data Science, Data Analytics,
Cryptography, Machine Learning, and backend development.
